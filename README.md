## My Personal Website

This is my personal website built with Next.js, designed for speed, simplicity. It showcases my work, projects, and thoughts, featuring a modern UI powered by Tailwind CSS and optimized for performance.

### Getting Started

I am using `bun` in this project instead of `npm`. First, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
